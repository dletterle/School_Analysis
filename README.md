# School_District_Analysis
An analysis of school district information regarding preparing all standardized tests for analysis, reporting and presentations to provide information about performance trends and patterns. 

**Overview**

The purpose of this analysis is to assist Maria and her supervisors because they have been notified from the school board of academic dishonesty, specifically reading and match grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for assistance. Maria has in turn askeded to replace the match and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the math and reading scores are replaced, Maria has also requested for the process to be repeated for the school district analysis.
